[h3] What is a trait? [/h3]
Traits are stat boosts and/or reductions that are applied per citizen based on chance, the chance depends on the trait, for example, genius have a lower chance of appearing than animal lover. 
A citizen may have several traits, just one, or none. Each stat boost only applies to that citizen.
Traits are a way to give flavour to your citizens, adding a bit of text to their bio.
