[h3] Supported versions [/h3]
V65 - V70

[h3] Description [/h3]
This mods adds several tech nodes that cost the minimun (a bug in V69+ doesnt allow free techs), allowing the player to choose/forget them at any point.
Most of these new nodes give a 10% boost per level in a certain stat, like 10% more ore from mining, and have a maximun level of 20.

The point of this mod is to allow players to buff a certain stat, and whenever they want forget that knowledge. For example, if you think ore production at the beggining is very slow, you can buff it and when you want to, refund the tech boost.
From V69+, AI does not benefit from these boosts.

[h3] Compatibility [/h3]
This mod only adds, it doesnt touch any vanilla file, therefore it should be compatible with all mods.
Should be safe to add/remove to a save, do a backup first just in case! Your allocated knowledge points may reset after adding the mod.
