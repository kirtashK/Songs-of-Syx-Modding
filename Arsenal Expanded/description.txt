All these items are made at a new workshop, Armory.
This mod also adds technology nodes to unlock the armory, boosts & upgrades to the armory, recipes, and for V66+, a training range to improve crossbow skill.

[h3] What about AI factions? [/h3]
The mod adds new divisions along with the vanilla ones in order to allow AI to use these items, for example, you may find a division carrying plate armor, heavy shield and a morning star, as well as a division with armor leather, vanilla shield and dagger. In total, this mod adds 27 options for divisions, 8 of them being vanilla options carrying banners, whetsones or heavy shields.

[h3] Compatibility [/h3]
Doesnt touch vanilla files so it should be compatible with other mods.
Requires a new save, cant be removed from a save.
