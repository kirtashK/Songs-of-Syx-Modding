All these items are made at a new workshop, Armory.
This mod also adds technology nodes to unlock the armory, boosts & upgrades to the armory, recipes, and for V66+, a training range to improve crossbow skill.

[h3] What about AI factions? [/h3]
The mod adds new divisions along with the vanilla ones in order to allow AI to use these items, for example, you may find a division carrying plate armor, heavy shield and a morning star, as well as a division with armor leather, vanilla shield and dagger. In total, this mod adds 27 options for divisions, 8 of them being vanilla options carrying banners, whetsones or heavy shields.

[h3] Attack speed [/h3]
You may notice that the weapon's tooltips call attack speed as offence skill, and offence skill as offence skill too, this is a vanilla problem, both atributes have the same name when shown in tooltips.
While testing the mod, I noticed attack speed (ATTACK_RATE) wasnt working, reported the bug to Jake who says he will check it eventually.

[h3] Compatibility [/h3]
For V65, this mod touches only one vanilla file, assets/init/room/ARCHERY_VANILLA, it adds two lines to that file so crossbows get a ranged skill, so training affects it, and adds a small boost to stamina to the training, in the case of a conflicting mod, depending on mod order, one mod will overwrite the other mod's conflicting file. Compatible with any mod that doesnt touch such file.
For V66+, crossbow training has been moved to a new training range to improve compatibility.
Requires a new save, cant be removed from a save.
